## Logic, python and introduction to OOP.

#### My solutions for exercises proposed in one of my first programming courses developed at Alura.

##### • Motivation
Develop solutions for exercises using python. Part of the project are simple games, one being a hangman and the other a guessing game.

##### • How it works
forca.py is the hangman game and adivinhacao.py is the guessing game. adivinhacao.py requires a file called palavras.txt with the words that will be used in the game. You can download the games separately or together with the jogos.py file, which when launched, allows the user to select which of the games he wants to play.
